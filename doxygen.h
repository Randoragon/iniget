 * @section intro Introduction
 *
 * You are reading the documentation of the @c iniget command-line utility program.
 * It is targeted at developers trying to understand the inner-workings
 * of the program, not casual users (for that you can see
 * <a href="https://github.com/randoragon/iniget/tree/main/README.MD">README</a>).
 *
 * The code base makes an extensive use of comments to explain the general flow
 * of the program and each structure/function/constant should be explained in
 * decent detail in its header file, which is then available for viewing here.
 * <br/>In general, the Doxygen documentation contains explanation of each individual
 * component of the program, while source files (which are not parsed by Doxygen)
 * contain comments explaining what the program does with these components.
