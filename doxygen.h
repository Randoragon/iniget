/** @mainpage Documentation Main Page
 *
 * @section intro Introduction
 *
 * You are reading the documentation of the @c iniget command-line utility program.
 * It is targeted at developers trying to understand the inner-workings
 * of the program, not casual users (for that you can see
 * <a href="https://github.com/randoragon/iniget/tree/main/README.MD">README</a>).
 * 
 * @c iniget is not a complicated program, but its code base is messy enough to
 * make reading a bit difficult, and orderly enough to benefit from a good
 * explanation of its components.
 *
 * @section toc Table of Contents
 *
 * Note that this Table of Contents lists only documentation written as separate
 * pages of information, to form a foundation for understanding the actual source code.
 * These pages, however, are only a small part of the entire documentation.
 * A substantial chunk is written for specific structures, functions and variables only,
 * so be sure to refer to those in order to fill some gaps.
